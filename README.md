## Our Mission

Making friends as an adult is a challenge. There are other social media sites for starting groups like meetup.com but they are complicated structuring group activities into rigid schedules. Wolf-pack offers a simple app that connects people simply by filling out a form to start a group or just performing a search and applying to a group to join. Scheduling of events or meetings within the groups is left to the user and can be set up through chatting just like how you would if you met these people in real life, like “hey do you want to meet at starbucks on friday to talk about that new book?” “Sure, that sounds great!.” 

Wolf-Pack is a social site for creating and joining social groups. Find your pack! Search through posting of other groups and find a group that you want to join. Start your own pack. Create a pack and post it for other members to join, your pack can be anything from a band to a brunch group! Chat with members in your pack in the app so you can meet up in real life and have fun together.
