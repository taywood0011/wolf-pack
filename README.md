## Wolf-Pack

Making friends as an adult is a challenge. There are other social media sites for starting groups like meetup.com but it can be complicated to structure group activities into rigid schedules. Wolf-pack offers a simple app that allows users to connect by searching for packs by category and inviting users with similar interests to chat within a pack.

## Getting Started

Wolf-Pack is a social site for creating and joining social groups. Find your pack! Search through packs by category and find a group that you want to join. Start your own pack, and and post it for other members to join. Your pack can be anything from a band to a brunch group! Chat with members in your pack in the app so you can meet up in real life and have fun together. Create a howl to be found by other pack members and invited to a pack.
